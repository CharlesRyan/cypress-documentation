Easy with traditional server side rendered apps.

To demonstrate how simple of a problem this is.

- add class async
- attach DOM node async
- check a checkbox async

Strategies

- ensure you've waited for anything asynchronous to be done
- use a then and query synchronously
- repeat the test dozens of times if you want to see what happens
